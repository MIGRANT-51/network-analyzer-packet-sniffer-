<h1 align="center" id="title">Network analyzer(Packet Sniffer)</h1>

<p id="description">This Python software is a basic packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network traffic. It intercepts packets via raw sockets and returns complete information on IPv4 and IPv6 packets as well as TCP UDP and ICMP headers.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Packet Filtering: Users can filter packets based on protocols (ICMP UDP TCP) by specifying a filter when running the script.
*   extensive Output: The script outputs extensive information about TCP packet source and destination addresses ports and flags.
*   IPv4 and IPv6 Support: It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols for comprehensive network analysis.
